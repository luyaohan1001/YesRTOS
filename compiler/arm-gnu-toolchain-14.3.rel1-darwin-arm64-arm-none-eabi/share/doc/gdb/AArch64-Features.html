<h4 class="subsection">G.5.1 AArch64 Features</h4>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-AArch64-features"></a>

<a name="AArch64-core-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.1 AArch64 core registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.core</samp>&rsquo; feature is required for AArch64
targets.  It must contain the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>x0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>x30</samp>&rsquo;, the general purpose registers, with size of
64 bits.  Register &lsquo;<samp>x30</samp>&rsquo; is also known as the <em>link register</em>,
or &lsquo;<samp>lr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>sp</samp>&rsquo;, the stack pointer register or &lsquo;<samp>x31</samp>&rsquo;.  It is 64 bits in size and
has a type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pc</samp>&rsquo;, the program counter register.  It is 64 bits in size and has a type
of &lsquo;<samp>code_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>cpsr</samp>&rsquo;, the current program status register.  It is 32 bits in size
and has a custom flags type.
</li></ul>

<p>The semantics of the individual flags and fields in &lsquo;<samp>cpsr</samp>&rsquo; can change as
new architectural features are added.  The current layout can be found in the
aarch64-core.xml file.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-floating_002dpoint-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.2 AArch64 floating-point registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.fpu</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present,
it must contain the following registers:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>v0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>v31</samp>&rsquo;, the vector registers with size of 128 bits.  The
type is a custom vector type.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point status register.  It is 32 bits in size and has
a custom flags type.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point control register.  It is 32 bits in size and has
a custom flags type.
</li></ul>

<p>The semantics of the individual flags and fields in &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo;
can change as new architectural features are added.
</p>
<p>The types for the vector registers, &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo; registers can
be found in the aarch64-fpu.xml file.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-SVE-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.3 AArch64 SVE registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sve</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present,
it means the target supports the Scalable Vector Extension and must contain
the following registers:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>z0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>z31</samp>&rsquo;, the scalable vector registers.  Their sizes are
variable and a multiple of 128 bits up to a maximum of 2048 bit.  Their type is
a custom union type that helps visualize different sizes of sub-vectors.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point status register.  It is 32 bits in size and has
a custom flags type.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point control register.  It is 32 bits in size and has
a custom flags type.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>p0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>p15</samp>&rsquo;, the predicate registers.  Their sizes are
variable, based on the current vector length, and a multiple of
16 bits.  Their types are a custom union to help visualize sub-elements.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>ffr</samp>&rsquo;, the First Fault register.  It has a variable size based on the
current vector length and is a multiple of 16 bits.  The type is the same as
the predicate registers.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>vg</samp>&rsquo;, the vector granule.  It represents the number of 64 bits chunks in
a &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; register.  It is closely associated with the current vector
length.  It has a type of &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> sees the SVE feature, it will assume the Scalable Vector
Extension is supported, and will adjust the sizes of the &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>p</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>ffr</samp>&rsquo; registers accordingly, based on the value of &lsquo;<samp>vg</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> will also create pseudo-registers equivalent to the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo;
vector registers from the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.fpu</samp>&rsquo; feature.
</p>
<p>The first 128 bits of the &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo; registers overlap the 128 bits of the
&lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; registers, so changing one will trigger a change to the other.
</p>
<p>For the types of the &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>p</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>ffr</samp>&rsquo; registers, please
check the aarch64-sve.c file.  No XML file is available for this feature
because it is dynamically generated based on the current vector length.
</p>
<p>The semantics of the individual flags and fields in &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo;
can change as new architectural features are added.
</p>
<p>The types for the &lsquo;<samp>fpsr</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>fpcr</samp>&rsquo; registers can be found in the
aarch64-sve.c file, and should match what is described in aarch64-fpu.xml.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-Pointer-Authentication-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.4 AArch64 Pointer Authentication registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>&rsquo; optional feature was introduced so
<small>GDB</small> could detect support for the Pointer Authentication
extension.  If present, it must contain one of two possible register sets.
</p>
<p>Pointer Authentication masks for user-mode:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_dmask</samp>&rsquo;, the user-mode pointer authentication mask for data
pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_cmask</samp>&rsquo;, the user-mode pointer authentication mask for code
pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li></ul>

<p>Pointer Authentication masks for user-mode and kernel-mode:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_dmask</samp>&rsquo;, the user-mode pointer authentication mask for data
pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_cmask</samp>&rsquo;, the user-mode pointer authentication mask for code
pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_dmask_high</samp>&rsquo;, the kernel-mode pointer authentication mask for
data pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pauth_cmask_high</samp>&rsquo;, the kernel-mode pointer authentication mask for
code pointers.  It is 64 bits in size.
</li></ul>

<p>If <small>GDB</small> sees any of the two sets of registers in this feature, it will
assume the target is capable of signing pointers.  If so, <small>GDB</small> will
decorate backtraces with a &lsquo;<samp>[PAC]</samp>&rsquo; marker alongside a function that
has a signed link register value that needs to be unmasked/decoded.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> will also use the masks to remove non-address bits from pointers.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Please note the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>&rsquo; feature string is deprecated
and must only be used for backwards compatibility with older releases of
<small>GDB</small> and <code>gdbserver</code>.  Targets that support Pointer
Authentication must advertise such capability by using the
&lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2</samp>&rsquo; feature string instead.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2</samp>&rsquo; feature has the exact same contents
as feature &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The reason for having feature &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2</samp>&rsquo; is a bug in
previous versions of <small>GDB</small> (versions 9, 10, 11 and 12).  This bug
caused <small>GDB</small> to crash whenever the target reported support for Pointer
Authentication (using feature string &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>&rsquo;) and also
reported additional system registers that were not accounted for by
<small>GDB</small>.  This is more common when using emulators and on bare-metal
debugging scenarios.
</p>
<p>It can also happen if a newer gdbserver is used with an old <small>GDB</small> that
has the bug.  In such a case, the newer gdbserver might report Pointer
Authentication support via the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>&rsquo; feature string
and also report additional registers the older <small>GDB</small> does not know
about, potentially leading to a crash.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-TLS-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.5 AArch64 TLS registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.tls</samp>&rsquo; optional feature was introduced to expose
the TLS registers to <small>GDB</small>.  If present, it must contain either one
of the following register sets.
</p>
<p>Only &lsquo;<samp>tpidr</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>tpidr</samp>&rsquo;, the software thread id register.  It is 64 bits in size and has a
type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>Both &lsquo;<samp>tpidr</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>tpidr2</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>tpidr</samp>&rsquo;, the software thread id register.  It is 64 bits in size and has a
type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>tpidr2</samp>&rsquo;, the second software thread id register.  It is 64 bits in size
and has a type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.  It may be used in the future alongside
the Scalable Matrix Extension for a lazy restore scheme.
</li></ul>

<p>If <small>GDB</small> sees this feature, it will attempt to find one of the
variations of the register set.  If &lsquo;<samp>tpidr2</samp>&rsquo; is available,
<small>GDB</small> may act on it to display additional data in the future.
</p>
<p>There is no XML for this feature as the presence of &lsquo;<samp>tpidr2</samp>&rsquo; is
determined dynamically at runtime.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-MTE-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.6 AArch64 MTE registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.mte</samp>&rsquo; optional feature was introduced so
<small>GDB</small> could detect support for the Memory Tagging Extension and
control memory tagging settings.  If present, this feature must have the
following register:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>tag_ctl</samp>&rsquo;, the tag control register.  It is 64 bits in size and has a type
of &lsquo;<samp>uint64</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>Memory Tagging detection is done via a runtime check though, so the presence
of this feature and register is not enough to enable memory tagging support.
</p>
<p>This restriction may be lifted in the future.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-SME-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.7 AArch64 SME registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain registers <code>ZA</code>, <code>SVG</code> and <code>SVCR</code>.
See <a href="AArch64.html#AArch64-SME">AArch64 SME</a>.
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <code>ZA</code> is a register represented by a vector of <var>svl</var>x<var>svl</var>
bytes.  See <a href="AArch64.html#svl">svl</a>.

</li><li>- <code>SVG</code> is a 64-bit register containing the value of <var>svg</var>.  See <a href="AArch64.html#svg">svg</a>.

</li><li>- <code>SVCR</code> is a 64-bit status pseudo-register with two valid bits.  Bit 0
(<small>SM</small>) shows whether the streaming <acronym>SVE</acronym> mode is enabled or disabled.
Bit 1 (<small>ZA</small>) shows whether the <code>ZA</code> register state is active (in use) or
not.
See <a href="AArch64.html#aarch64-sme-svcr">aarch64 sme svcr</a>.

<p>The rest of the unused bits of the <code>SVCR</code> pseudo-register is undefined
and reserved.  Such bits should not be used and may be defined by future
extensions of the architecture.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme</samp>&rsquo; feature is required when the target also
reports support for the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme2</samp>&rsquo; feature.
</p>
<a name="AArch64-SME2-registers-feature"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.1.8 AArch64 SME2 registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme2</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present,
then the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme</samp>&rsquo; feature must also be present.  The
&lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sme2</samp>&rsquo; feature should contain the following:
See <a href="AArch64.html#AArch64-SME2">AArch64 SME2</a>.
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <code>ZT0</code> is a register of 512 bits (64 bytes).  It is defined as a vector
of bytes.

</li></ul>

<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
