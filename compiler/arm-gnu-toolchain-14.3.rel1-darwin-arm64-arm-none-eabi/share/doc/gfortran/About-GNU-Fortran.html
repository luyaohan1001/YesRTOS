<h3 class="section">1.1 About GNU Fortran</h3>

<p>The GNU Fortran compiler is the successor to <code>g77</code>, the
Fortran 77 front end included in GCC prior to version 4 (released in
2005).  While it is backward-compatible with most <code>g77</code>
extensions and command-line options, <code>gfortran</code> is a completely new
implemention designed to support more modern dialects of Fortran.
GNU Fortran implements the Fortran 77, 90 and 95 standards
completely, most of the Fortran 2003 and 2008 standards, and some
features from the 2018 standard.  It also implements several extensions
including OpenMP and OpenACC support for parallel programming.
</p>
<p>The GNU Fortran compiler passes the
<a href="http://www.fortran-2000.com/ArnaudRecipes/fcvs21_f95.html">NIST Fortran 77 Test Suite</a>, and produces acceptable results on the
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/lapack/faq.html">LAPACK Test Suite</a>.
It also provides respectable performance on
the <a href="https://polyhedron.com/?page_id=175">Polyhedron Fortran compiler benchmarks</a> and the
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/livermore">Livermore Fortran Kernels test</a>.  It has been used to compile a number of
large real-world programs, including
<a href="http://hirlam.org/">the HARMONIE and HIRLAM weather forecasting code</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/dylan-jayatilaka/tonto">the Tonto quantum chemistry package</a>; see
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GfortranApps">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GfortranApps</a> for an extended list.
</p>
<p>GNU Fortran provides the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Read a program, stored in a file and containing <em>source code</em>
instructions written in Fortran 77.

</li><li> Translate the program into instructions a computer
can carry out more quickly than it takes to translate the
original Fortran instructions.
The result after compilation of a program is
<em>machine code</em>,
which is efficiently translated and processed
by a machine such as your computer.
Humans usually are not as good writing machine code
as they are at writing Fortran (or C++, Ada, or Java),
because it is easy to make tiny mistakes writing machine code.

</li><li> Provide information about the reasons why
the compiler may be unable to create a binary from the source code,
for example if the source code is flawed.
The Fortran language standards require that the compiler can point out
mistakes in your code.
An incorrect usage of the language causes an <em>error message</em>.

<p>The compiler also attempts to diagnose cases where your
program contains a correct usage of the language,
but instructs the computer to do something questionable.
This kind of diagnostic message is called a <em>warning message</em>.
</p>
</li><li> Provide optional information about the translation passes
from the source code to machine code.
This can help you to find the cause of
certain bugs which may not be obvious in the source code,
but may be more easily found at a lower level compiler output.
It also helps developers to find bugs in the compiler itself.

</li><li> Provide information in the generated machine code that can
make it easier to find bugs in the program (using a debugging tool,
called a <em>debugger</em>, such as the GNU Debugger <code>gdb</code>).

</li><li> Locate and gather machine code already generated to
perform actions requested by statements in the program.
This machine code is organized into <em>modules</em> and is located
and <em>linked</em> to the user program.
</li></ul>

<p>The GNU Fortran compiler consists of several components:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A version of the <code>gcc</code> command
(which also might be installed as the system&rsquo;s <code>cc</code> command)
that also understands and accepts Fortran source code.
The <code>gcc</code> command is the <em>driver</em> program for
all the languages in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC);
With <code>gcc</code>,
you can compile the source code of any language for
which a front end is available in GCC.

</li><li> The <code>gfortran</code> command itself,
which also might be installed as the
system&rsquo;s <code>f95</code> command.
<code>gfortran</code> is just another driver program,
but specifically for the Fortran compiler only.
The primary difference between the <code>gcc</code> and <code>gfortran</code>
commands is that the latter automatically links the correct libraries
to your program.

</li><li> A collection of run-time libraries.
These libraries contain the machine code needed to support
capabilities of the Fortran language that are not directly
provided by the machine code generated by the
<code>gfortran</code> compilation phase,
such as intrinsic functions and subroutines,
and routines for interaction with files and the operating system.

</li><li> The Fortran compiler itself, (<code>f951</code>).
This is the GNU Fortran parser and code generator,
linked to and interfaced with the GCC backend library.
<code>f951</code> &ldquo;translates&rdquo; the source code to
assembler code.  You would typically not use this
program directly;
instead, the <code>gcc</code> or <code>gfortran</code> driver
programs call it for you.
</li></ul>
